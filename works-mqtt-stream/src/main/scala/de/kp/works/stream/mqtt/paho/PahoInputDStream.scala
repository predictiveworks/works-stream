/**
 * MQTT v3.1 & MQTT v3.1.1
 * 
 * 
 * This input stream uses the Eclipse Paho MqttClient (http://www.eclipse.org/paho/).
 * 
 * Eclipse Paho is an umbrella project for several MQTT and MQTT-SN client implementations. 
 * This project was one of the first open source MQTT client implementations available and 
 * is actively maintained by a huge community. 
 * 
 * Paho features a Java client which is suited for embedded use, Android applications and 
 * Java applications in general. The initial code base was donated to Eclipse by IBM in 2012.
 * 
 * The Eclipse Paho Java client is rock-solid and is used by a broad range of companies from 
 * different industries around the world to connect to MQTT brokers. 
 * 
 * The synchronous/blocking API of Paho makes it easy to implement the applications MQTT logic 
 * in a clean and concise way while the asynchronous API gives the application developer full 
 * control for high-performance MQTT clients that need to handle high throughput. 
 * 
 * The Paho API is highly callback based and allows to hook in custom business logic to different 
 * events, e.g. when a message is received or when the connection to the broker was lost. 
 * 
 * Paho supports all MQTT features and a secure communication with the MQTT Broker is possible 
 * via TLS.
